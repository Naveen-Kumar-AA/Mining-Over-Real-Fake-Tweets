# Mining Over Real and Fake Tweets

This project aims to identify and visualize patterns in real and fake tweets using data mining techniques. The analysis encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and association rule mining to uncover significant patterns in tweet data.

## Project Description

The spread of misinformation on social media platforms like Twitter is a growing concern. This project investigates the use of text mining techniques to identify patterns in tweets that differentiate between real and fake news content. Inspired by the work presented in "Mining Text Patterns over Fake and Real Tweets", we implemented a system to extract these patterns from a dataset (twitter_fakenews_USElections_2016) of tweets.

Our approach involves transforming tweets into a structured format suitable for pattern discovery. This allows us to utilize association rule learning to uncover frequent word combinations and stylistic elements characteristic of real and fake news. The extracted patterns can then be employed by machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of fake news detection on Twitter.

This project contributes to the field of fake news detection by demonstrating the potential of text mining for uncovering hidden patterns in social media content. The findings can be used to develop more robust methods for identifying and mitigating the spread of misinformation online.
